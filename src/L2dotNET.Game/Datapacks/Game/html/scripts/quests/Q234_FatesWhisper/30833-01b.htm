We hope to collect <font color="LEVEL">Baium's blood</font> from the Tower of Insolence. Surely you have heard of how Baium was descended from King Shunaiman, who received the blessing of Einhasad in person! We must obtain the accursed royal blood from his veins.<br>
Take this <font color="LEVEL">pipet knife</font> and cut Baium. Once the knife absorbs his blood and turns red, bring it to me.<br>
Although others have succeeded in infiltrating the tower recently, your task will not be easy. Go now and talk to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Hanellin of Aden Castle Town</font>.</body></html>
