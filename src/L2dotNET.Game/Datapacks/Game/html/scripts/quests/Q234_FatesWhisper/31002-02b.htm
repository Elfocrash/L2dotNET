<html><body>Maestro Reorin:<br>
Don't bother! The only way I could possibly have my honor restored would be to stop my dealings with demons. However I... I... cannot refuse their requests.<br>
They have the soul of my wife, and are holding her hostage! If I don't do exactly as they say, they will throw her soul into eternal torment! I cannot let this happen to my dear Reiria, my honor is sacrificed for her!<br>
