Welcome. Do you want to get aboard? Now we have quite a number of routes here at Gludin. We even had a test operation on the route to the Elmore Kingdom, with whom we once were at odds. Now we have regular liners and shuttles as there been a growing nimber of users to the pleasure of me.<br>
Would you try a regular liner ship to the Rune Township of Elmore? It is on a regular schedule.<br>
