For the honor of the eternal flame! Greetings, brothers of fire!<br>
My name is Kunai! You look like you could use some new weapons! I happen to have just gotten a shipment of the last Dwarven weapons, and I hate to say it, but they're the highest-quality I've ever seen! I despise the Dwarves more than most, but I can't quarrel with their craftmanship! Crafty little devils, they are! Besides, if I didn't sell them, the Humans or the Elvel would!<br>
