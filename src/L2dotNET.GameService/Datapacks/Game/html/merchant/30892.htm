<html><body>Trader Enverun:<br>
Welcome, traveler. We stock magic-related items and all sorts of general merchandise. Our customers are not only Wizards and Mystics but also Warriors looking for protection against magic attack and young ladies looking for pretty accessories... We have a very diverse and large clientele. Occasionally we get unwelcome customers who flip through spellbooks, looking for a clue to find <font color="LEVEL">Othellot's Sword</font>. They seem to think my store is their private libary!<br>
