<html><body>Head Blacksmith Mendio:<br>
I'm Head Blacksmith Mendio of the Black Anvil guild, here in Gludin. In all sincerity, I can tell you that without the Black Anvil Guild, human civilization would still be in a very primitive condition. Do you think the races could march out to war or lay siege to enemy cities without us? Not a chance! Without our siege golem and weapons, warriors would be forced to fight with sticks and stones instead of steel. How foolish would they seem then!<br>
Ah, but I didn't intend to lecture you. My apologies. What is the reason for you visit, then?<br>
