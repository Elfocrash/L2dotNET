<html><body>Maestro Reorin:<br>
Well, I suppose that I will have to trust you. But mark my words, if the soul of my wife suffers any torment, I will hold you personally responsible!<br>
Now listen carefully. <font color="LEVEL">Messenger Cabrio</font> is a cruel collector of souls. This demon keeps the souls in this world, never allowing them to cross into eternal rest. Some time ago, the soul of my wife was added to his collection!<br>
He can be found in <font color="LEVEL">the Cemetery</font> in Aden...<br>
Please free my wife's soul from this wicked demon...<br>
