They say that there are truly fascinating items to be found out in the wide world. I've never seen them, but people say that there are fire breathing swords, and even magical shoes that let you fly through the air... Do you really think that something like that might exist? Have you ever seen such things? There are many fascinating accessories here in our shop, but I can't believe that such powerful items really exist. Ah, I apologize. I've been talking too much. So, what can I do for you?<br>
