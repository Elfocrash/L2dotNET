Do you mean to say that this is the first you've heard of this? You must have never been to Innadril before. The sword is the symbol of the Lord of Innadril. Many years ago, from the sea befor us there, Fafurion the dragon awoke as from a bad dream and set about creating havoc. Lionel Hunter was still a young man at that time, and he single-handedly defeated the dragon and managed to put it back to sleep... Eva was so impressed by his bravery that she bestowed upon him Othellot's Sword.. Since then, the sword has become a symbol of the Lord of Innadril. That's the <font color="LEVEL">Othellot's Sword</font>.<br>
But recently, catastrophe struck. The sword simply vanished! Nobody, including the Lord. has any idea what happened to it. And now Giran is talking advantage of our vulnerability, disrupting our trade activities at every opportunty!<br>
