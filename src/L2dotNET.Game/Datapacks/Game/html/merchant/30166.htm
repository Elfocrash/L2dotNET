Hmm...  Welcome to my shop. You can expect honest treatment here.  Ah,  high-level Spellbooks are very hard to get.  I have heard that the monsters around the Ivory Tower possess them.  You might try there.  Who knows?  Fortunately, you might get a high-level Spellbook.  Would you like to see my wares?<br>
