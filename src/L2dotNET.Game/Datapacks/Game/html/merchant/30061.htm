Uncle Sabrin says that the best life is to be prosperous in business, but I don't think so. A man should make his mark in the world. I'm stuck here selling wares, but I'm getting out soon. I'm going to the capital of Aden, where there are large castles and impressive buildings, to pursue my dreams.<br>
