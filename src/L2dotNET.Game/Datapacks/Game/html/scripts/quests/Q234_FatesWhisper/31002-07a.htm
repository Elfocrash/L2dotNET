My rivals stole it from me when I was expelled from the guild! Instead of defending me, they helped themselves to my materials and tools! Thankfully, I was able to hide away my work journal.<br>
I have heard that the <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmith Ferris</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Aden Castle Town</font> has my hammer. At one time he was one of my apprentices. When I had my problems with the guild, he turned on me like a bad dog. I cannot bear to see him. Please go and get my hammer from him.</body></html>
