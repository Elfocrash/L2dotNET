Have you forgotten about our deal? Let me refresh your memory: You will need to talk to Magister Hanellin of Aden Castle Town. He will tell you how to enter Baium's room. Once inside, wake up Baium and stab with the pipette knife till his blood turns it red. Come back to me with the red pipette knife and I shall give you the Reorin's Mold.
Ah, one more thing. The entrance to the room where Baium stays is locked.</body></html>
