Well, you see, I was out of money and I really needed a drink, and well, you know...I sold it to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Zenkin</font> of <font color="LEVEL">Oren Castle Town</font>...<br>
Could I ask you but one more favor? Will you please go and see Trader Zenkin and buy the mold back for me? Oh, thank you! You are such a helpful person!</body></html>
