Are you the one that woman was talking about?<br>
What woman...? I don't know. I had never seen her before. She was quite beautiful, with blonde hair and blue eyes. She said that soon I would have an important visitor and that I should make a top-quality weapon for that person! Sadly, I've been thrown out of the guild. I explained to her that I no longer make weapons. But she wouldn't accept any of my excuses. She said that I would know after meeting you that I must once again pick up the hammer.<br>
But what am I to do? I drank away the money she gave me...Even if I wanted to make a weapon for you, I don't have the money to pay for the materials I need!<br>
